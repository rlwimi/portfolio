## Current Projects

### [Major Input](https://github.com/rlwimi/major-input)
This iPad app presents a novel UI for quickly reading WWDC session transcripts while retaining video/presentation context. It's a text scrubber for video, turning the passive experience of watching a video into an active, engaging reading experience, and saving the user time as a result.
