### [Major Input](https://github.com/rlwimi/major-input)

This iPad app presents a novel UI concept for swiftly reading WWDC session transcripts without losing the video/presentation context. It's a text scrubber for video, turning the passive experience of watching a video into an active, engaging reading experience, while saving a little time.

### [Ibotta](https://ibotta.com)

An iPhone app for the Ibotta platform, providing cash back rewards for consumer purchases since 2012. Launched a campaign to correct the course of a legacy, mixed Swift/Objective-C codebase with 2% test coverage that was proving problematic for team velocity, stability of releases, and maintainability. Introduced an MVVM-C architecture for greenfield work, with some additional concepts from VIPER, RIBs, React, and Redux, supporting integration with legacy work and progressive migration. Enabled rapid iteration and sustainable support of new features in an IB-free environment with: composable, Auto Layout-based UI components and assembly infrastructure supporting a highly dynamic UI driven by backend data, unit testing of view models, snapshot testing of UI components and screens, and Playground-driven UI development. Maintained codebase integrity while executing migrations to new releases of Swift, iOS, dependencies, and CI tooling. Enabled testability across the codebase. Built and executed our release process weekly. Modified team workflows and built feature flag infrastructure to support the organization’s highly dynamic and decentralized approach to feature development. Extensively mentored a team growing from 4 to 10, advocating and teaching good software engineering principles. Wrote a team style guide with some enforcement automated by SwiftLint.

### [Beam](https://mutualmobile.com/work/beam-for-ios)

After developing some HomeKit expertise, and before Apple released its HomeKit app including Control Center integration with iOS 10, we saw a large gap in the market for a beautiful, functional, universal HomeKit app, so we built Beam. Beam almost certainly influenced Apple's approach to designing their iOS Home app. Beam has been discontinued.
